# NeuralNetwork_from_scratch

User Input: Number of neurons in the input layer, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in the hidden layers. 
Assume random weights and activation function as sigmoid. 
Compute the output of each hidden layer.                                        

Print the following:
Dimension of weight matrix and the input vector for the computation of each hidden layer.                
Output dimension of each hidden layer.
